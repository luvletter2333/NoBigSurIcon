# No Big Sur Icon

**Any Pull Request is welcomed !!!!**


## Introduction

After macOS Bug Sir update, many applications like Chrome start to change their icons with new design styles. But some users like me don't like them, so this repo is aimed at providing users with their former icons.


## List

| Name          | Link                                           | Version |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Google Chrome | [Link](NoBigSurIcon/Google%20Chrome/README.md)   | 86      |


## Directory Format

Take `Google Chrome` as example:

- ./Google Chrome/ :
  - app.icns
    - The name of icns file should be equal to the one in `Google Chrome.app`
  - README.md
    - Tutorial to replace, including file path and points for attention
